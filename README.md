# Promisified espeak

This is a simple wrapper of the Linux application espeak, used to text-to-speech. It has a `Promise` based api and the availables methods are:

## say(text, opts)

Calls espeak using the text passed on the first parameters and include any additional arguments passed on the second parameter

# male1, male2, male3, male4, male5, male6 and male7

It's exactly the same as the `say` method but use one of espeak's male default voice

# female1, female2, female3, female4, female5

It's exactly the same as the `say` method but use one of espeak's female default voice
